    About
  </h1>
  <p>
    <br>Hi</br> I am Ayan Mitra. I come from the beautiful city of Calcutta (now called as  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata">Kolkata</a>), India. Growing up I studied in St. Stephen's School, Dum Dum and the completed my B.Sc. (Hons) from the St. Xaviers College (now University) under the University of Calcutta, in physics. Since then I have been mostly a vagabond travelling across many countries and continents, all while trying to do some science or rather learn more of it. Currently I am an <a href="https://www.lsst.org/">LSST</a> postdoctoral fellow at the <a href="https://www.iucaa.in/en/">IUCAA</a>, India. I work with Professor Surhud More. My research interests include Supernova Ia, dark energy and cosmology and Machine Learning (ML).
